      "question": "In a certain garden of bean plants, the pod colour is either red or green. When a pure breeding bean plant with red pods was crossed with another pure breeding bean plant with green pods, all the offspring produced red pods. When the offspring were allowed to self pollinate, the following results were obtained; 580 bean plants had red pods while 206 had green pods. Explain the genetics of this cross using appropriate symbols and diagrams",
