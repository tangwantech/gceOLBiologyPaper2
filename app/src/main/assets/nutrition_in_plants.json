The oxygen gas was then lost from the plant as a waste product and collected in the test tube. It is the oxygen gas which cause the glowing splint to rekindle.\n\n In the control experiment, there was no green plant to absorb sunlight energy for use in the photolysis of water. Hence, no oxygen gas was produced, so the glowing splint did not rekindle",
